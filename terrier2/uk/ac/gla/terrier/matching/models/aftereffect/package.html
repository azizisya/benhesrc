<p>Provides the interface and the classes for implementing the term frequency
normalisation component in the DFR framework. The implemented classes can be used by
specifying
the class name in /etc/trec.models, or in property trec.model. For instance, adding
a line DFRWeightingModel(P,L,2) in file /etc/trec.models tells the systems to use the
PL2 model to run retrieval. P stands for class P in this package, L stands for class L in
package uk.ac.gla.terrier.matching.basicmodel, and "2" stands for class 2 in this
package.</p>
