<p>Provides classes and interfaces related to the indexing of documents.
There are three main abstract concepts that are related to the code
of this package.</p>
<p>The first is the concept of a collection of documents. This can be 
a standard TREC test collection, or a connection to a database from 
where the documents are extracted.</p>

<p>The second abstraction is the concept of a document. An implementation 
of a collection should iterate through the documents in the collection 
and return one at a time. The document encapsulates the parser required
to extract the information to index. Implementations of documents are
provided for TREC documents, PDF documents and standard Microsoft Office
formats, such as MS Word, MS Powerpoint and MS Excel.</p>

<p>The third abstraction is related to the indexer, the process that 
iterates through the documents of a collection and creates the 
necessary data structures. There are two implemented indexers. The first
one saves field information, if specified, while the second one saves
position information as well.</p>
