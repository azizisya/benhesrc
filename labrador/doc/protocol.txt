HELO
I am a client, ready to do work. Here is my UID

CONF
I'd like to know what my configuration should be
Can you please tell me it?

NEXT
Could I have some URLs to work on please? If followed
by an integer, this is the number of URLs I'd like to
work on, if possible.

FINISHED url
I've finished parsing this URL. Here are the links
it contained - you should add these to your queue
for filtering and crawling

ROBOTS hostname
Do you have the robots.txt file for hostname?

ROBOTSFILE hostname
Here is the contents of the robots.txt file for 
hostname. Please save it in your cache.

STATS
Here are my stats, add these to your totals

MONITOR
Please give me all your available stats

WORK
Is there any work available yet? I'd like to fork
some clients to do some work for you.

NOOP
Just checking the connection is OK. Meaningless packet.

ALLOWED
Can you check that this URL is allowed by the URL filters?

FINGERPRINT
Here is the fingerprint of this URL. Can you check if you've seen 
it before.

CHECKPOINT
Please checkpoint your data structures to disk now.

This process is shutting down (or at least disconnecting).
Please disconnect me.

Notes
-----
* Only HELO and QUIT are permitted if a client hasn't logged on yet 
(ie called HELO)
