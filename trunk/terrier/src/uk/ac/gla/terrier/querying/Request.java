* Request
* SearchRequest contains the details of the search engine for one query, including the query itself,
* the resultset, and the controls. Controls set application specific parameters, which often load
* post proceses, and postfilters, or set matching parameter. These are fundamentally, the <b>names</b>
of the modules to be used for each stage of a query:
* <ul>
* <li>The matching and weighting modules to be used</li>
* <li>postProcess modules to apply transforms to the resultset</li>
* <li>postFilter modules to apply transforms to the resultset</li>
* </ul>
* A Request is an implementation of the SearchRequest interface.
* Additionally, the Request holds all the controls set for this query.
