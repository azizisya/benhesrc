/** Bayesian smoothing with Dirichlet Prior. This has one parameter, mu &gt; 0. "The optimal value of
 * mu also tends to be larger for long queries than for title queries. The optimal ... seems to vary from
 * collection to collection, though in most cases, it is around 2,000. The tail of the curves is generally
 * flat.". This class sets mu to 2500 by default. As a default, this gives higher performance than 
 * BM25 (b=0.75) on TREC Terabyte track 2004.
 * <p>
 * The retrieval performance of this weighting model has been empirically verified to be similar to that reported
 * below. This model is formulated such that all scores are &gt; 0.
