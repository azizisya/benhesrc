/**
 * Implements an InputStream, that encapsulates another stream, but only upto the
 * point that a pre-defined end marker in the stream is identified. The Reader
 * will then become endOfFile, and refuse to return any more bytes from the
 * stream. Suppose that we create an instance of a LookAheadStream with the 
 * end marker END. For the following input:
 * <tt>a b c d END e f g...</tt>
 * the LookAheadStream, will stop after reading the string END. Note that the 
 * end marker will be missing from the parent stream.
 * <p>LookAheadStream allows the encoding to be changed between markers. Handy
 * for collections of webpages, which may use different encodings. However, the
 * end marker must be obtainable using the default encoding.
